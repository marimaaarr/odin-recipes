    <p><strong>What is Spam?</strong></p>
    <p>Spam is canned meat that comes in different flavours such as tocino, teriyaki or Szechuan. 
        The original spam flavour is commonly used for this recipe.It is a food staple for many 
        Hawaiians and can be eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
    <p><strong>Make your own Musubi mold</strong></p>
    <p>Musubi molds can be purchased online, but can also be made at home using the can of the spam.
         You will need to take both sides of the lid off, clean out the can and cut it half of the
          original height. Make sure to get rid of the sharp edges.</p>
