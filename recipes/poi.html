        <img src="../images/poi.jpg">

        <h2>Poi is a traditional staple food in the Polynesian and Hawaiian diet. It is made from the root
            bulb of taro plants which is then mashed with water and allowed to ferment.
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 mins</p>
        <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 50 mins</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb taro root, scrubbed clean, peeled and cut into 2 inch chunks</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place taro root chunks in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water. Steam taro until
                    fork soft (about 20-25 minutes)</li>
                <li>Transfer taro into a s mortar and pound with a pestle for about 20 minutes until all 
                    the fibres and lumps are gone, and the consistency is a nice and smooth paste</li>
                <li>Continue mashing as you pour a little water at a time until you get the desired consistency and enjoy</li>
                <li><em>Optional:</em> Do not refrigerate if you want to ferment. Place poi in a non-reactive bowl and
                    and place a kitchen towel over it. Good option for probiotics</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Poi is served in a big communal bowl, but can also be served in individual bowls
            as well to accompany kalua pork, grilled huli huli chicken, and Hawaiian macaroni salad.</p>
